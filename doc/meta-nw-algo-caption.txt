Figure meta-nw-algo. Schematic of modified Needleman-Wunch algorithm for global alignment to a reference genome. The process starts with contigs (blue diagonals) that are locally aligned to a reference genome (A). All possible combinations of these local alignments are enumerated by realizing all paths connecting contigs from the upper left to lower right corner of the matrix (B). Each alignment is scored: matches contribute positive scores (dark blue lines in C), while indels (red) and mismatches (gold) incur a penalty (D). The alignment with the highest score is selected as the best global alignment (E) for the next step in graph genome creation; ties among global alignments are resolved arbitrarily.
