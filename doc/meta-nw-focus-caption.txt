Figure meta-nw-focus. Focus on entry and exit points for obtaining global alignments. Diagonal blue lines represent local alignments between a reference sequence and an input sequence. Circles indicate types of entry and exit points used to in the algorithm to define paths through the alignment space. See text for details of algorithms and formal definitions of entry and exit points.
