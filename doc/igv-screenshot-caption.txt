Figure igv-screenshot. The HLA-B region for the genome graph produced by our approach as visualized in the Integrated Genomics Viewer (Thorvaldsd√≥ttir et al. 2012). (a) shows the coverage (gray bar) of the eight included assemblies (NA19240, HX1, etc.) and the alignment of each to the graph genome. Colored vertical lines indicate sequence variants (green = A, blue = C, orange = G, red = T), horizontal black lines indicate deletions, and vertical purple "I" characters show insertions. (b) displays annotations mapped onto the alignment.
